But this doesn’t have to be a problem as long as you start implementing security in DevOps on time. Lot of features that DevOps processes use, like Infrastructure as a Code or Configuration as a Code, can be used to secure your security. Using and rotating secrets can help and if you really want to increase security you can add JEA and JIT for secure deployments. Join us in this feature-packed session where you will discover DevOps security nuggets, see real world examples and learn to become DevOps security expert!</p><p><strong>Mustafa Toroman - Solution Architect, Azure MVP</strong><br><sub>Mustafa Toroman is a solution architect with Authority Partners.

Having the code in place to deploy your solution and/or infrastructure is one part of the puzzle. But what if you are software company or a service provider and you are looking to scale this deployment across customers? Each customer will have its variables. There are many solutions out there that will help you package and deploy your solution, but they all have their quirks and limitations. That is not to say you shouldn’t use them but going the “Do it yourself” route provides you with much more flexibility and a better understanding of what’s really happening. And with that understanding you can still choose to invest in a third-party solution for your provisioning needs.
During this session we will dive into a use case and leverage technologies such as (Azure) PowerShell, ARM Templates, Azure KeyVault and Azure Table Storage to achieve effortless deployments across customers.</p><p><strong>Wesley Haakman - Lead Azure Architect at Intercept</strong><br><sub>Wesley is a Microsoft Azure MVP and is working as a Lead Azure Architect at Intercept.
