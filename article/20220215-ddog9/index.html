We believe GitHub has a lot to offer and deserves a user group in the Netherlands. But we also love the different elements that enable DevOps. So we decided to combine those two into the community you are looking at.<br>Our goal is to have a platform where we can teach, learn and meet each other.</p><hr><h2 id=tuesday-february-15th>Tuesday February 15th</h2><p>We are proud to announce our great speakers!</p><h2 id=getting-started-with-octopus-deploy>Getting Started with Octopus Deploy</h2><h4 id=sarah-lean>Sarah Lean</h4><p>In this session, I will show you how to get started with Octopus Deploy. I will walk you through how to deploy Azure infrastructure using the Runbooks features. Then take the code of an existing application and automate the deployment to that Azure infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Sarah Lean - Senior Solutions Architect at Octopus Deploy - Community Speaker - Lifelong Learner - Founder of the Glasgow Azure User Group</strong><br><sub>With a diverse career that spans over fifteen years, Sarah has been a part of every aspect of the IT world.

Azure Quantum & Microsoft Q#!</h2><h4 id=johnny-hooyberghs>Johnny Hooyberghs</h4><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard about quantum computing, but it still remains a mystery? In this introductory session, I will quickly explain important concepts like qubits, superposition and entanglement and how quantum computing can hopefully help us to solve exponentially large problems.</p><p>Some theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates and quantum algorithms will be combined with examples using a simulated environment on a local PC and on real quantum hardware using Azure Quantum. These examples will use the new quantum language Q# from Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Johnny Hooyberghs - Passionate Developer at Involved and Microsoft MVP</strong>
