The launch of DDOG is scheduled for
Thursday 13 August We want to create a community for content related to DevOps and GitHub. We believe GitHub has a lot to offer and deserves a user group in the Netherlands. But we also love the different elements that enable DevOps. So we decided to combine those two into the community you are looking at.</description></item></channel></rss>
