I&rsquo;m here to explain how our team made it work, and what benefits we got out of it!</p><p>I love working in a team, bouncing ideas off each other and using our combined strengths to produce something that as individuals we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to come up with.</p><p>One way I like to do this is pair programming. But, when I talk to people about this, I often get told it&rsquo;s a waste of time. That it’s about one person working hard whilst the other looks on, superfluous to the process. And let&rsquo;s face it, most of us have experienced this when trying it out!</p><p>But I’m going to show you how we went from this sleepy type of pair programming to being super productive when working with multiple developers at one machine!</p><p>Not the one person working, one person staring into space type of pair programming, but actually providing value to each other, making the extra effort worthwhile, and bringing extra benefits to the team as a whole.</p><p><strong>Stacy Cashmore - Tech Explorer DevOps @ Omniplan</strong><br><sub>Stacy is Tech Explorer DevOps at Omniplan, and Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies.</p><p></sub><sub>She’s been developing software since the mid-1990s and has been speaking about improving the way we develop software at conferences and meetups since 2018</p><p></sub><sub>As well as sparing with the software architect about technical issues, she spends her time helping the development team, and the wider company, with continuous improvement in terms of technical work, process and, of course, working together as a team.</p><p></sub><sub>Outside of work she enjoys spending time with her classic car, cooking, playing the piano badly and spending time with her family, doing amongst other things, building a Lego modular building city in their house.</sub></p><h2 id=creating-the-azure-functions-updates-twitterbot>Creating the Azure Functions Updates Twitterbot</h2><h4 id=marc-duiker>Marc Duiker</h4><p>I created a serverless Twitterbot which tweets when new releases are made available in public GitHub repositories related to Azure Functions.</p><p>In this session, I&rsquo;ll walk you through the serverless application, highlighting which Azure cloud services and Azure Function specific libraries are in use and why they&rsquo;ve been chosen. I&rsquo;ll show two architectural patterns which are used: function chaining and fan-out/fan-in and I&rsquo;ll cover the C# clients for GitHub and Twitter and describe their limitations.</p><p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll also go into continuous integration & deployment aspects so you&rsquo;ll end up with a complete picture of what is necessary to deliver a serverless solution to the Azure cloud.</p><p>**Marc Duiker - Lead Azure Consultant @ Xpirit **<br><sub>Marc is a lead consultant at Xpirit with a strong focus on event-driven architectures.
