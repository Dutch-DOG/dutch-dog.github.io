The launch of DDOG is scheduled for
Thursday 13 August We want to create a community for content related to DevOps and GitHub. We believe GitHub has a lot to offer and deserves a user group in the Netherlands. But we also love the different elements that enable DevOps. So we decided to combine those two into the community you are looking at.</description></item><item><title>We're on EventBrite!</title><link>//ddog.nl/link/eventbrite/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 16:48:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>//ddog.nl/link/eventbrite/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
